This is my new, updated portfolio that is statically generated, leverages SSR and hydration, and deployed on Cloudflare Pages. 

I have written it in Imba, which I've found to be a wonderfully concise language compared to some of the others with regards to UI development. Even though the community is small, it seems an awesome prototyping language. 

- The static site generator uses code from a fork of https://github.com/trafnar/imba-builder (ISC license), and it is ironic because Nathan originally taught the Imba course that got me interested. Please do check out Nathan's presence here https://www.nathanmanousos.com/.   


I have forked the template here (https://github.com/chints98/imba-builder), with the goal of trying to extend it out into generating posts / and, or rendering markdown files as blogs.
